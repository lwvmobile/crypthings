# Crypthings

A collection of various encryption ciphers, utilities, and tools written in C.

`git clone https://github.com/lwvmobile/crypthings.git --recursive`

Open the crypthings/compiled folder and run `sh gcc-compile.sh` to compile tools for Linux.
Run with `./aes-ofb-crypt.o` in the terminal, for example.

Run `sh cross-compile.sh` to cross compile on Linux platform to Windows as .exe files.
Windows users, precompiled exe files will be available under releases.

See the README.md file in the crypthings folder for more information on Crypthings programs.
